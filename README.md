# Legend-of-Blue-Earth
This is a prototype game that I'm currently using as a class project. Collaboration is welcome. Thank you in advance.

I realize that this is completely unrealistic for the beginner game, but these are the eventual goals that we'll be putting into a playable full game.
Game aspect goals:
1.	Dynamic Character Creation – Players can either choose from the pre-generated character aspects or use their imagination to create their own character concept using dynamic creation software. The first iteration of this system will be an a la cart, step by step process.
2.	Dynamic Crafting – Players can use pre-defined recipes and plans to build, cook, forge, or otherwise create things, or they can design their own recipes and see what happens. Crafting isn’t just limited to things, potentially they can manipulate genes or conduct animal husbandry.
3.	Dynamic World – Although there is a pre-generated world, the world can be changed by players by mining, explosions, and constructing/destroying buildings.
4.	NPC/PC Interplay – Players will have the option of allowing their characters to become functional NPC’s while they are signed off, or perhaps even if they go AFK for too long.
5.	PVP – Battle with other players on multiple levels. Repeated kills cause anti-body-like defenses to build up which could potentially result in temporary immunity from a certain character, which prevents camp killing. Also, characters will have a certain resistance to higher layer characters as long as they stay within certain areas. A new character in a starting zone is effectively immune to attacks from high layer characters.
6.	Artifacts – There are certain items in the game which will give an advantage to the person/guild/faction which possesses it. These artifacts can be taken at any time.
7.	Cyclical Main Story – There is a main quest chain, which will eventually teach you all you need to know about the game. This chain changes over time, so the next time you create a new character, it is very likely that you will see quests that you haven’t done before. Some quests are seasonal, so that when the season in the world changes, so do the available quests.
8.	AI Bosses – Although bosses will have a relatively limited amount of abilities, the higher the layer of the boss, the more the boss is capable of learning from its encounters with players. There will not be any static patterns to end game boss fights although some moves will still have tells that will allow players to set up tactics against them.
